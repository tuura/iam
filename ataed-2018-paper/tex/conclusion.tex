The paper presents a polymorphic metalanguage for describing semantics of
instruction set architecture. The metalanguage closely resembles state transformers.
The polymorphism of the metalanguage combinators allows to evaluate the semantics
of instruction in different contexts without anyhow modifying the semantics itself.
As the primary application, we present an approach to deriving concurrency oracles
of the instructions with only static data dependencies.
