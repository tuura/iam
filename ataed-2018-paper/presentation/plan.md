Demonstrate the static dependency graph semantics for individual
instructions and then for blocks of instructions.

Then transfer to the dependency matcher oracle and demostrate its work on
a short example without going into details of the implementation.

Next, partial orders and scenarios. POs are retrieved from the unfolded
static dependency graphs. POs may be synthesised into a CPOG. That gives
a way to implement efficient hardware microcontrollers which implement
the control scenarios encoded by the POs.

Conclude with the discussion of the future work: unify all the approaches into
a single framework.
