Concurrency oracles here are these three things:

1. Static data dependency graphs (original and unfolded).
2. The origin oracle from the paper: one that detects read, write and read-write
conflicts.
3. Partial Orders and the CPOG synthesised representation.

Deciding whether two given events in a trace are concurrent, i.e. have no causal
or data dependencies between them, is a major problem in the process discov-
ery field [3]. Various methods for concurrency extraction, often referred to as
concurrency oracles
